        I am a Junior Full-Stack Software Developer and love coding and have
        started on a learning journey that will last a lifetime. I learnt HTML,
        CSS, Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript and enjoyed solving problems
        and building applications. I am also a Researcher in Entrepreneurship of
        the software industry and published papers in academic books and

      <h3>Personality</h3>

        I am a curious person and open to new ideas. I like to try new
        technologies and learning new skills and knowledge. I am
        self-disciplined. When I met difficulties, I proactively sought for
        solutions and cooperated with colleagues to complete tasks. I am
        sociable and loving people. I often hang out with my colleagues outside
        of work and love to catch up with friends on weekends.
      </p>
      <h3>Interests</h3>

        I love traveling and understanding all different cultures and reading
        history books. I like kayaking, dancing flemanco, playing accordions and
        piano, cooking delicious food, and designing clothes. I also enjoy
        learning about new technologies, AIs, and aerospace.
