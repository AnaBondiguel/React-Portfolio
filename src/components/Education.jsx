      description:
        "The purpose of this thesis was to examine how entrepreneurial firms combine the use of intuitive and analytical decision-making to recognize opportunities. It was a multiple-case study using an interpretive paradigm. Forty-eight interviews were conducted in eight software companies, and analysed by comparing foundersâ€™ and managersâ€™ decision-making processes. The grounded theoretical model of dynamic intuitive-analytic capabilities extends the literatures of dynamic capabilities, intuition, dual process theory, product innovation, an entrepreneurial opportunity, and helps to answer one of the most commonly asked questions in the field of entrepreneurship: why some entrepreneurial companies are more successful than others.",

        "The thesis focuses on how New Zealandâ€™s software firms engage in overseas export activities, and what exporting strategies they use to be successful. The study develops a theoretical model of New Zealandâ€™s software born-global companiesâ€™ internationalization process. The model makes contributions to the theoretical concepts â€“ born-global, psychic distance, and global mindset and also recommendations to New Zealandâ€™s government policies.",
